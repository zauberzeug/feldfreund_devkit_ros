# Feldfreund DevKit ROS

Feldfreund DevKit ROS is a comprehensive ROS2 package that handles the communication and configuration of various Feldfreund components:

- Communication with Lizard (ESP32) to control the Feldfreund
- GNSS positioning system
- Camera systems (USB and AXIS cameras)
- Example UI to control the robot

All launch files and configuration files (except for the UI) are stored in the `devkit_launch` package.

## Components

### DevKit driver

The DevKit driver builds on the [feldfreund_devkit](https://github.com/zauberzeug/feldfreund_devkit) hardware abstraction (based on [RoSys](https://rosys.io/)) and exposes the robot's state and controls as ROS2 topics.
The hardware itself is driven by an ESP32 "robot brain" running [Lizard](https://lizard.dev/) firmware; the robot brain and its Lizard configuration are managed through `feldfreund_devkit`.
The driver runs against real hardware or, when `FELDFREUND_SIMULATION` is set, against a built-in simulation.

Configuration:

- `devkit_launch/config/feldfreund.py`: Hardware configuration of the DevKit (robot brain, wheels/ODrive, bumpers, IMU, ...), assembled via `feldfreund_devkit`.
- `devkit_launch/config/devkit.yaml`: ROS2 parameters for the driver node (odometry covariances `pose_stddev` / `twist_stddev` and `publish_tf`).

Published topics (driver → ROS):

- `/odom` (nav_msgs/Odometry): Robot odometry data
- `/battery_state` (sensor_msgs/BatteryState): Battery status information
- `/bumper/front_top` (std_msgs/Bool): Front top bumper state
- `/bumper/front_bottom` (std_msgs/Bool): Front bottom bumper state
- `/bumper/back` (std_msgs/Bool): Back bumper state
- `/estop/front` (std_msgs/Bool): Hardware front emergency stop state
- `/estop/back` (std_msgs/Bool): Hardware back emergency stop state
- `/clock` (rosgraph_msgs/Clock): Simulation time (published in simulation mode only)

Subscribed topics (ROS → driver):

- `/cmd_vel` (geometry_msgs/Twist): Control robot movement
- `/estop/soft` (std_msgs/Bool): Software emergency stop control
- `/esp/enable` (std_msgs/Empty): Enable the robot brain (hardware mode)
- `/esp/disable` (std_msgs/Empty): Disable the robot brain (hardware mode)
- `/esp/reset` (std_msgs/Empty): Reset the robot brain (hardware mode)
- `/esp/restart` (std_msgs/Empty): Restart the robot brain (hardware mode)
- `/esp/configure` (std_msgs/Empty): Send the Lizard configuration to the robot brain (hardware mode)

### Camera System

The camera system supports both USB cameras and AXIS cameras, managed through a unified launch system in `camera_system.launch.py` that handles USB cameras, AXIS cameras, and the Foxglove Bridge for remote viewing.

The USB camera system provides video streaming through ROS2 topics using the `usb_cam` ROS2 package. Camera parameters can be configured through `config/camera.yaml`.

The AXIS camera system integrates with the [ROS2 AXIS camera driver](https://github.com/ros-drivers/axis_camera/tree/humble-devel) to support multiple IP cameras with individual streams. Each camera can be configured through `config/axis_camera.yaml`, with credentials managed through `config/secrets.yaml` (template provided in `config/secrets.yaml.template`). The cameras' authentication mode (basic or digest) might need to be configured - see [AXIS Camera Authentication](#axis-camera-authentication) section for details.

The visualization system integrates with [Foxglove Studio](https://foxglove.dev/) for remote camera viewing, supporting compressed image transport. The Foxglove Bridge is accessible via WebSocket connection on port 8765.

### GNSS System

The GNSS system uses the [Septentrio GNSS driver](https://github.com/septentrio-gnss/septentrio_gnss_driver) with the default `config/gnss.yaml` configuration. Available topics:

- `/pvtgeodetic`: Position, velocity, and time in geodetic coordinates
- `/poscovgeodetic`: Position covariance in geodetic coordinates
- `/velcovgeodetic`: Velocity covariance in geodetic coordinates
- `/atteuler`: Attitude in Euler angles
- `/attcoveuler`: Attitude covariance
- `/gpsfix`: Detailed GPS fix information including satellites and quality
- `/aimplusstatus`: AIM+ status information

### DevKit UI

The example UI provides a robot control interface built with NiceGUI, featuring a joystick control similar to turtlesim. It gives you access to and visualization of all topics made available by the DevKit driver, including:

- Robot movement control through a joystick interface
- Real-time visualization of GNSS data
- Monitoring of safety systems (bumpers, emergency stops)
- Software emergency stop control

The interface is accessible through a web browser at `http://<ROBOT-IP>:80` when the robot is running.

## Docker Setup

### Using Docker Compose

1. Build and run the container:

```bash
cd docker
docker-compose up --build
```

2. Run in detached mode:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Attach to running container:

```bash
docker-compose exec devkit bash
```

4. Stop containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

The Docker setup includes:

- All necessary ROS2 packages
- Lizard communication tools
- Camera drivers
- GNSS drivers

## Connect to UI

To access the user interface (UI), follow these steps:

1. **Connect to the Robot's Wi-Fi:**
   Join the robot's WLAN network.

2. **Open the UI in your browser:**
   Navigate to:

   ```
   http://<ROBOT-IP>:80
   ```

   (Replace `<ROBOT-IP>` with the actual IP address once you have it.)

## Launch Files

The system can be started using different launch files:

- `devkit.launch.py`: Launches all components
- `devkit_nocams.launch.py`: Launches all components without the cameras
- `devkit_driver.launch.py`: Launches only Feldfreund DevKit driver
- `camera_system.launch.py`: Launches complete camera system (USB + AXIS) and Foxglove Bridge
- `usb_camera.launch.py`: Launches USB camera only
- `axis_cameras.launch.py`: Launches AXIS cameras only
- `gnss.launch.py`: Launches GNSS system
- `ui.launch.py`: Launches the example UI node

To launch the complete system:

```bash
ros2 launch devkit_launch devkit.launch.py
```

## AXIS Camera Authentication

The AXIS cameras can be configured to use either digest or basic authentication. To check and configure the authentication mode:

1. Check current authentication settings:

```bash
curl --digest -u root:pw "http://192.168.42.3/axis-cgi/admin/param.cgi?action=list&group=Network.HTTP" | cat
```

2. Switch authentication mode (e.g., from digest to basic):

```bash
curl --digest -u root:pw "http://192.168.42.3/axis-cgi/admin/param.cgi?action=update&Network.HTTP.AuthenticationPolicy=basic" | cat
```

Replace `root:pw` with your camera's credentials and `192.168.42.3` with your camera's IP address. The authentication mode can be set to either `basic` or `digest`. Note that you should always use the `--digest` flag in these commands even when switching to basic auth, as the camera's current setting might be using digest authentication.

## Quickstart guide

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zauberzeug/devkit_ros.git
cd devkit_ros
```

### 2. Validate Configuration

Before building, check and adjust if needed:

1. **Hardware Configuration** (`devkit_launch/config/feldfreund.py`):
   - Verify the robot brain, wheel/ODrive CAN addresses, bumper pins and IMU offsets match your hardware

2. **ROS2 Driver Configuration** (`devkit_launch/config/devkit.yaml`):
   - Adjust the odometry covariances (`pose_stddev`, `twist_stddev`) and `publish_tf` if needed

### 3. Build with Docker

```bash
./docker.sh u
```

### 4. Send Lizard Configuration

Once the system is running, send the Lizard configuration to the robot brain:

- Use the "Configure" button in the UI
- Or publish to the `/esp/configure` topic in ROS2

### 5. Ready to Go

Check the UI at `http://<ROBOT-IP>:80` to control and monitor your robot.
